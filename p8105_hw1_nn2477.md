**Data set description:** This data set contains weather factors for the
first half of January 2013. It has 358 observations and 15 variables,
including dew point, humidity, wind characteristics, precipitation, and
pressure. The mean temperature for the first half of January 2013 was
39.58 degrees Fahrenheit with a standard deviation of 7.06.

**Creating scatter plot and saving graph**

``` r
#load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

#making scatterplot using ggplot function 
scatter_plot <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    x = "Time (Hours)",
    y = "Temperature",
    title = "Scatterplot of Temperature vs Time with Humidity Color Code"
  ) + 
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") + 
  theme_minimal()

#print scatterplot 
print(scatter_plot)
```

``` r
#save scatter plot as png
ggsave("scatterplot.png", plot = scatter_plot)
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

**Scatter plot description:** there seems to be an overall positive
correlation, meaning that as time (hrs) increases, temperature also
increases as well. however, no clear trend is evident, indicating a weak
correlation between time and temperature

    ## [1] NA

I was able to take the mean for the variables “random_sample” and
“logical_vector” because it contains numeric and/or logical values. I
was unable to take the mean for variables “character_vector” and
“factor_vector” because it is not a numeric and/or logical outputs.

``` r
#apply as.numeric() to logical, character, and factor variables 
numeric_logical <- as.numeric(df$logical_vector)
```

Using the as.numeric() function on the logical vector converts ‘true’
values to 1 and ‘false’ values to 0. This conversion makes sense because
‘true’ and ‘false’ are usually treated as 1 and 0 in many data sets.
This explains why when we take the mean of the “logical_vector”
variable, we will get a value between 0 and 1.

``` r
numeric_character <- as.numeric(df$character_vector)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

Using the as.numeric() function on the character vector in R, it tries
to convert the character values to numeric values. However, since our
values are non-numeric characters, R converts them to missing values
(NAs). We are unable to find the mean of the “character_vector” variable
because of the presence of NAs (it would just give us an NA), thus it
explains why we get an NA as the output when we try to find the mean for
this variable.

``` r
numeric_factor <- as.numeric(df$factor_vector)
```

Using the as.numeric() function on the factor vector in R, it attempts
to convert the factor levels based on their internal encoding and these
numeric values may not align with the intended factor order. This helps
explain why I get an NA when attempting to find the mean since factors
are categorical variables and their levels are represented as integers
internally.
